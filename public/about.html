    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
        I am an avid runner and cyclist who enjoys the outdoors when the weather allows.<br>
        I am also a gamer, who will sometimes spend hours on my PS5, just grinding away.<br>
        Recently I have decided to learn a new skill, and since Web Development is something that I've always had an interest in, I decided to go through Angela Yu's bootcamp course. So far it's been a blast, and a great way to keep my skills sharp.
